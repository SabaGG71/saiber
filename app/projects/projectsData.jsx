      "I began the Wild Oasis project by taking a Udemy course focused on building websites with Next.js and Supabase. As a beginner in web development, I was excited to dive into these tools, as they offered powerful features for creating dynamic, full-stack web applications. Next.js helped me quickly set up a server-side rendered site with efficient routing, while Supabase provided an easy-to-use backend for authentication and database management. The course guided me through setting up a reservation system and integrating these technologies, allowing me to focus on building a functional, user-friendly website. This project was a great learning experience, and it helped me apply and improve my skills in both front-end and back-end development.",

I integrated Supabase for user authentication and reservation data storage. Then, I developed features like cabin booking and calendar functionality. After testing and final adjustments, I deployed the website on Vercel, ensuring smooth user experience and real-time updates. This project allowed me to apply React, Next.js, and Supabase skills in building a real-world web application.",
